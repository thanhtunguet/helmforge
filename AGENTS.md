# Development rules

- If you need to write document / memory files, prioritize to write it in `docs/` directory.
- Run eslint after making changes to format the code and find related issues.
- Don't run dev server. If you need to do that to check code, ask user to do it manually.
- If you add new features or make a breaking changes to features, remember to update README accordingly.


# Typescript rules

- Avoid using "any". Declare correct types for particular usages.
- Use camelCase naming convention
